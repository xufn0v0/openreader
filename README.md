# OpenReader

A self-hosted ebook reader with multi-device sync, online book sources, local book import, WebDAV, RSS, and a reader experience aligned with reader-dev.

Everyone is welcome to use OpenReader and actively submit [Issues](https://github.com/changshengyu/openreader/issues) with bug reports and suggestions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OpenReader is an independent Go/Vue refactor and rewrite of [changshengyu/reader-dev](https://github.com/changshengyu/reader-dev), not a drop-in replacement for its executable or database. Upstream behavior at commit [`fa22f271`](https://github.com/changshengyu/reader-dev/commit/fa22f271849d45f93349ae1636223e27b16a4691) is the compatibility baseline. The refactor is active; see the [compatibility audit](docs/compat/refactor-audit-matrix.md) for current module status.

## Features

- **Local books** — Import TXT, EPUB, UMD, and CBZ; preview and customize TXT chapter rules. Existing Markdown/PDF archives from earlier OpenReader versions remain readable.
- **Online sources** — Import and manage reader-dev/Legado-compatible sources, search across sources, browse catalogs, switch sources, and cache chapters.
- **Upstream-aligned reader** — Vertical paging, horizontal swiping, and continuous vertical scrolling; desktop, phone, and tablet layouts; bookmarks, in-book search, progress sync, themes, typography, auto-reading, and TTS.
- **Bookshelf workspace** — Groups, search, batch operations, metadata editing, local storage, WebDAV file management, and cross-client refresh.
- **Content cleanup** — Ordered regular-expression replacement rules for advertisements, watermarks, and formatting noise.
- **RSS and discovery** — Import RSS sources, browse articles, and explore source catalogs.
- **Backup and restore** — reader-dev/Legado-compatible logical ZIP restore, OpenReader logical backups, and portable v2 backups containing recoverable local-book originals and supported custom appearance assets.
- **Multi-user** — JWT authentication, per-user data isolation, source/store/WebDAV permissions, and administrator management.
- **Single container** — One Go binary serves the API and built Vue application; SQLite runs in WAL mode.

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/changshengyu/openreader.git
cd openreader
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate a secret with `openssl rand -hex 32`, place it in `OPENREADER_JWT_SECRET`, and set `OPENREADER_CORS_ORIGIN` to the public origin from which you will open OpenReader (for example, `https://reader.example.com`). Then start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. The first account registered in an empty installation becomes the administrator; later accounts are regular users.

The included Compose file mounts `./data`, `./cache`, and `./library`. Do not remove or replace these directories when recreating the container.

### Upgrade an Existing OpenReader Deployment

First make a cold backup. Stopping the container ensures the SQLite database and its WAL files are captured consistently:

```bash
docker compose stop openreader
tar -czf "../openreader-volume-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz" data cache library .env docker-compose.yml
docker compose pull openreader
docker compose up -d --force-recreate openreader
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

The archive contains the JWT secret and user data; store it with restricted access. The bundled Compose file uses `pull_policy: always`. The `version` and `commit` returned by `/api/health` identify the code actually running; refreshing the browser does not update a container.

For a controlled rollout, pin `ghcr.io/changshengyu/openreader:<commit>` instead of `latest`. To roll back safely, stop the candidate, restore the complete pre-upgrade snapshot into empty persistent directories, pin the previous image, and start again. Do not merge an old SQLite snapshot into directories already written by a newer container.

## Migration Guide

Choose the migration path by what you are moving:

| Source | Recommended method | What it preserves |
|---|---|---|
| reader-dev or Legado | Restore its logical `backup*.zip` into the target OpenReader account | Supported sources, bookshelf entries, groups, RSS, bookmarks, replace rules, and progress present in the archive |
| Another OpenReader account/host | Create and restore an **OpenReader portable backup** | Logical account data plus recoverable local-book originals and supported custom covers/backgrounds/fonts |
| A complete OpenReader installation | Cold-copy `data/`, `cache/`, and `library/` together, plus deployment configuration | All users, SQLite data, uploads, backups, original local books, and cached content |
| An older OpenReader version on the same host | Keep the same three mounts and recreate the container with the new image | Existing installation data through additive startup migrations |

### Migrate from reader-dev

1. **Create a final backup in reader-dev.** Use its existing backup/WebDAV action to produce a `backup*.zip`. Download that ZIP and also keep an independent copy of the old reader-dev data directory and every original local book.
2. **Keep the old service unchanged.** Do not point OpenReader at the reader-dev database or overwrite `data/openreader.db`; the database schemas and filesystem layouts are different.
3. **Start OpenReader and create the destination account.** On a new installation, register the administrator first. For a multi-user reader-dev deployment, restore one user's archive while signed in as the corresponding OpenReader account; accounts and passwords are not contained in the logical backup.
4. **Upload the archive.** Open the sidebar and choose **WebDAV → 文件管理 (File Manager)**, click **上传文件 (Upload Files)**, and upload the original ZIP without unpacking or renaming its JSON files.
5. **Restore it.** Click **恢复 (Restore)** on the uploaded ZIP and confirm. OpenReader recognizes reader-dev/Legado names such as `bookSource.json`, `bookshelf.json` or `myBookShelf.json`, `bookGroup.json`, `rssSources.json`, `bookmark.json`, `replaceRule.json`, and `bookProgress/*.json`.
6. **Read the restore summary.** A user without source-edit permission still gets personal data restored, but sources are skipped and the UI reports that explicitly. Ask an administrator to grant source-edit permission before retrying if those sources are required.
7. **Re-import local originals.** A normal reader-dev/Legado backup does **not** contain original TXT/EPUB/UMD/CBZ files. Upload and import those originals separately. OpenReader portable backups can carry supported local originals, but only after the books already live in OpenReader.
8. **Verify before switching traffic.** Compare bookshelf and source counts, open several remote and local books, check bookmarks and progress, and test one source refresh. Keep the old deployment and its backup until this verification is complete.

Restore maps data to the currently authenticated OpenReader account and allocates destination IDs; IDs, user records, passwords, JWT sessions, WebDAV credentials, and host paths from the old installation are never reused. Restoration is transactional for supported logical data, but it is still a write operation—back up a non-empty destination first.

### Move OpenReader to Another Host

For an exact whole-instance move:

1. Stop the source container.
2. Copy `data/`, `cache/`, and `library/` together while the service is stopped. Copy `.env`/Compose configuration separately and preserve `OPENREADER_JWT_SECRET` if existing browser sessions should remain valid.
3. Start the destination with the same or a newer OpenReader image and the same mount paths.
4. Check `/api/health`, sign in, open local and remote books, and only then retire the source host.

For a single-account move, use **WebDAV → 保存完整可移植备份 (Save Portable Backup)**, download the resulting `portable_backup_*.zip`, upload it to the target account's WebDAV file manager, and click **恢复 (Restore)**. Portable generation intentionally fails instead of producing a partial package when a referenced local original or supported custom asset is missing. Local audio directories are not included.

### Backup Types and Limits

- `backup_*.zip` is a logical account backup. It is compatible with supported reader-dev/Legado JSON artifacts, but it does not contain the SQLite database or local-book originals.
- `portable_backup_*.zip` is an OpenReader portable v2 package. It adds validated local-book originals and supported current-user appearance assets; portable v1 packages remain restorable.
- A cold snapshot of all three persistent directories is the only complete system-level backup for all users.
- Never copy a reader-dev SQLite database over `data/openreader.db`, and never restore only one of OpenReader's three directories as if it were a complete instance migration.

## Persistent Data

| Directory | Purpose | Backup notes |
|---|---|---|
| `data/` | SQLite database, uploaded assets, and per-user WebDAV/backup files | Required for every full backup |
| `cache/` | Chapter/content and import-preview cache | Regenerable in many cases, but copy it for an exact move |
| `library/` | Imported original files and LocalStore content | Required to preserve local books |

The administrator keeps the historical WebDAV root under `data/webdav/`; regular users are isolated under user-specific descendants. The WebDAV protocol is available at both `/webdav/` and the reader-dev-compatible `/reader3/webdav/` path.

Book-source and RSS requests reject loopback, private, link-local, cloud metadata, benchmark, documentation, and other special-use networks by default. For a trusted LAN source, allow only the exact host or address when possible:

```yaml
environment:
  OPENREADER_SOURCE_NETWORK_ALLOWLIST: "nas.home,192.168.50.20"
```

The shared fetcher intentionally ignores ambient `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `ALL_PROXY`. Use the source's explicit proxy setting or a TUN/system route. Fake-IP DNS ranges such as `198.18.0.0/15` require an explicit exception and therefore authorize the entire range; prefer real-IP/Redir-Host DNS when practical.

## Development

### Local Development

```bash
cd backend
go mod tidy
go run .
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- API: `http://localhost:8080`
- Health check: `http://localhost:8080/api/health`

### Validation

```bash
cd backend && go test ./...
cd frontend && npm test
cd frontend && npm run build
```

Reader and workspace changes additionally require real-browser smoke checks. Release candidates are built locally and pass the mounted-volume/backup compatibility gate before publication.

<details>
<summary>Maintainer: build and publish the Docker image locally</summary>

Development publication defaults to `linux/arm64` on Apple Silicon:

```bash
docker login ghcr.io
./scripts/docker-build-push.sh
```

Publish the final `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` index with:

```bash
RELEASE=1 ./scripts/docker-build-push.sh
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/changshengyu/openreader:latest
```

Useful overrides include `TAG`, `IMAGE`, `PUSH=0`, `PLATFORMS`, `BUILD_PROGRESS=plain`, and `HOST_OCI_PUSH`. The script embeds `VERSION`, `VCS_REF`, and `BUILD_DATE`; formal releases remain local builds even when the host-network OCI publisher is used to upload the result.
