# OpenReader Compatibility API Contract

Status: working contract. Keep this file updated when endpoint semantics change.

## Global rules

- Public API root: `/api`.
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` for protected `/api` endpoints.
- WebDAV root: `/webdav`.
- Sync WebSocket: `/ws/sync`.
- Expected error shape for handled failures: JSON object with `error`.
- User-owned resources must be scoped to the authenticated user unless documented as admin/global.

## Public endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose | Compatibility notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Health and build metadata. | OpenReader runtime addition; keep stable for Docker/probes. |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/register` | Create user; first user becomes admin. | OpenReader multi-user addition. |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Return JWT and user object. | OpenReader auth addition; invalid credentials return `401`. |

## Protected endpoint groups

| Group | Representative paths | Contract notes |
|---|---|---|
| User/settings/admin | `/api/me`, `/api/settings/:key`, `/api/admin/users` | Settings are per user. Admin endpoints require admin role. |
| Sources | `/api/sources`, `/api/sources/import`, `/api/sources/:id/test*` | Preserve reader3-compatible source fields and parser semantics. |
| Bookshelf | `/api/books`, `/api/books/:id`, `/api/books/batch`, `/api/books/export` | Book operations must not cross user boundaries. |
| Reader content | `/api/books/:id/chapters`, `/api/books/:id/chapters/:index/content` | Content fetch should use cache when valid and return stable chapter data. |
| Reader legacy search | `/api/reader3/searchBookContent` | Compatibility endpoint; keep until old clients/routes no longer need it. |
| Progress | `/api/progress/:bookID`, `/api/progress` | Progress writes must be conflict-safe and user scoped. |
| Bookmarks | `/api/books/:id/bookmarks`, `/api/bookmarks/:id` | Bookmark CRUD and batch operations remain user/book scoped. |
| Local store | `/api/local-store*` | All paths must stay rooted under configured local store/library paths. |
| Import | `/api/imports/books/preview`, `/api/imports/books`, `/api/imports/txt` | Preview may return `importToken`; import must be able to reuse staged content. |
| Uploads | `/api/uploads` | Uploaded assets must be validated and rooted under data uploads. |
| Cache | `/api/cache/stats`, `/api/cache`, `/api/books/:id/cache` | Cache operations must not delete unrelated user data. |
| Replace rules | `/api/replace-rules*` | See the P2 replace-rule contract below: stable name-upsert order and upstream-visible plain/regex/scope semantics. |
| RSS | `/api/rss/sources`, `/api/rss/articles` | Remote fetch limits and parser safety apply. |
| Explore | `/api/explore/sources`, `/api/explore/:sourceId` | Browse source catalogs with bounded pagination/fetch behavior. |
| Backup/WebDAV import | `/api/backup/*`, `/api/webdav/import-*` | Backup/restore must preserve existing data and report clear compatibility failures. |

## P0 local TXT preview and staged-reparse contract

Status: implemented and backend/frontend-tested on 2026-07-11 against reader-dev `BookController.kt`, `LocalBook.kt` and `TextFile.kt`. OpenReader retains its JWT/JSON staging adaptation while restoring the upstream distinction between automatic no-TOC fallback and an explicit rule that found no headings.

| Method / path | Request | Success and side effects | Errors / retry contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/imports/books/preview` | Multipart `file`, optional `title`, `author`, `tocRule`, or an existing `importToken` instead of `file`. JWT required. | A new upload creates a caller-scoped immutable stage before parsing. Successful response is `200` with `{title,author,chapterCount,chapters,importToken}`. An empty `tocRule` uses the automatic first-512,000-byte probe and may return pseudo chapters for text without a TOC. | Unsupported/invalid input and an explicit `tocRule` that finds no chapters return `400` `{error,importToken}`. The token is retained for the caller to submit another preview rule; no book rows/cache files are created. |
| `POST /api/imports/books` | Same multipart/token fields plus existing category fields. JWT required. | `201` creates the book only from the staged bytes or submitted upload. A consumed staged token is deleted only after a successful import. | `400` for unsupported/parse/no-readable-chapter errors; failed parse/import leaves an existing stage reusable until normal expiry. |
| `POST /api/local-store/import-preview`, `POST /api/webdav/import-preview` | JSON `{paths}` or `{items:[{path,title,author,tocRule}]}`. JWT/store permission required. | `200 {items}`. Each readable item is copied once to a caller-scoped immutable stage; success item contains `{path,book,importToken}`. | A parser failure remains an item-level `{path,error,importToken}` in the `200` envelope. The token remains valid for a later `{items:[{path,importToken,tocRule}]}` preview/import; mounted-file mutation/removal cannot affect that retry. |
| `POST /api/local-store/import`, `POST /api/webdav/import` | Existing paths/items/category body. | Successful staged item uses the original preview bytes and deletes its token after durable import. | Item-level parser failures retain the staged token and do not create book/cache rows. A container response does not expose paths outside the caller's scoped store. |

This API shape is an allowed Go/JWT adaptation: reader-dev returns an empty chapter list in its controller response for a local `TocEmptyException`; OpenReader preserves deployed REST paths and reports the direct-preview failure as a `400`, but must preserve the retryable staged context in both direct and storage-backed flows.

## P2 replace-rule API contract

Status: extracted 2026-07-11 from fixed `reader-dev` `ReplaceRuleController.kt`, `ReplaceRule.vue`, `ReplaceRuleForm.vue`, and `Reader.vue`. OpenReader keeps REST/SQLite/JWT routes but must preserve the user-visible rule pipeline.

| Method / path | Request and validation | Success / side effects | Auth and errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/replace-rules` | None. | Returns only the caller's rules in stable insertion order (`id ASC`), never update-time order. Compatibility output retains `enabled` plus legacy-readable `isEnabled`. | JWT required; `500` only for a read failure. |
| `POST /api/replace-rules` | `{name, pattern, replacement, scope, isRegex, enabled|isEnabled}`. Name, pattern and scope are required; a missing `isRegex` means plain text; regex must compile under the reader-compatible case-insensitive mode. | Current-user name-upsert. Appending returns `201`; replacing the existing same-name row in place returns `200`, without moving pipeline order. Emits `replace_rules_update` after commit. | JWT required; `400` for missing fields/invalid regex; no cross-user lookup. |
| `PUT /api/replace-rules/:id` | Same validated fields. | Updates only the owned ID and does not change its stable position. Emits one post-commit update event. | JWT required; `400` invalid body/regex, `404` missing/foreign ID, `409` when renaming to another existing current-user name. |
| `POST /api/replace-rules/batch` | JSON array. Blank name/pattern rows retain the upstream-compatible `skipped` result. Every accepted rule must have a scope and valid plain/regex mode before any accepted row is written. | Transactional current-user name-upsert in input order, returning `{rules,created,updated,skipped}`. A malformed regex rejects the batch without a partial accepted-row write. | JWT required; `400` malformed array/regex/scope, `500` before a failed transaction can mutate state. |
| `POST /api/replace-rules/test` | `{pattern,replacement,isRegex,text}` using the same compiler/mode as real Reader content. | Returns `{input,output,changed}` only; no persistence or sync event. | JWT required; `400` invalid regex or missing pattern/text. |
| `DELETE /api/replace-rules/:id`, `POST /api/replace-rules/batch-delete` | Existing ID paths/payload. | Delete only owned rows, retain ordered `deletedIds`, and emit after durable deletion. | JWT required; single missing/foreign ID is `404`; invalid empty batch is `400`. |

Reader content applies enabled matching rules only to text chapters, in the same listed order: plain text changes the first occurrence; regex changes every case-insensitive occurrence. EPUB and audio content bypass the pipeline. A legacy persisted empty scope remains global only to avoid breaking existing OpenReader data; any successful edit/import writes an explicit non-empty scope.

## P1-D4 shelf-operation API contract

Status: extracted 2026-07-10. These routes retain their OpenReader paths while matching the fixed reader-dev shelf-operation behavior through a JWT/user-scoped adaptation.

| Method / path | Request | Success / side effects | Auth and errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PUT /api/books/:id/category` | `{ "categoryId": number }` or `{ "categoryIds": number[] }` | Replaces the shelf book's categories atomically, updates legacy primary `categoryId`, and emits one `bookshelf_update` after commit. The BookGroup set UI must not call this with an empty selection; direct API empty-array compatibility remains explicitly documented only if an ungrouped-book workflow needs it. | Owner only. `400` for malformed/foreign category, `404` for foreign/missing book, `500` only before an unsuccessful transaction can alter rows. |
| `POST /api/books/batch` | `{ "action": "delete"\|"category"\|"category-add"\|"category-remove"\|"cache"\|"clear-cache", "bookIds": number[], ... }` | Category and delete actions are transactional. Delete removes category links, chapters, bookmarks, progress, scoped browser-cache references and post-commit derived files; category actions emit one scoped `bookshelf_update`. Cache actions keep bounded request limits and emit affected shelf items only after durable cache state. | Owner only. Invalid/foreign category ids fail without mutation. Foreign book ids never expose or mutate another user's record; the response must distinguish an empty owned selection from a successful cross-user mutation. |
| `DELETE /api/books/:id` | None | Removes the caller's book rows in one transaction, broadcasts `bookshelf_delete` after commit, then prunes only that book's unreferenced remote cache files and private imported archive directory. | Owner only; `404` for another user's id. Failure before commit leaves all rows/files unchanged. Post-commit derived-cache cleanup is idempotent and must not delete another user's/shared path. |
| `POST /api/books/:id/cache` | `{ "chapterIndex"?: number, "all"?: boolean, "count"?: number }` | Remote books cache a bounded chapter window and return `{ cached, requested, book }`; local books return the existing no-server-cache result. A completed mutation publishes the refreshed shelf item. | Owner only; malformed payload `400`, missing book `404`. Count is bounded to protect server resources. |
| `POST /api/books/:id/cache/stream` | Same bounded cache body as `/cache`; authenticated `fetch` request with a readable response body. | Returns `text/event-stream`: each `message` event carries `{ bookId, cached, requested, total, chapterIndex, failed }`; terminal `end` carries `{ bookId, cached, requested, failed, book }`; a terminal `error` carries a client-safe error. Aborting the authenticated request is the cancellation action: the server stops scheduling further chapter fetches and does not send a shelf update for an incomplete job. The client must not put a JWT in a query string. | Owner only. Validation failures are ordinary JSON `400`/`404` before the stream opens. A disconnected/cancelled request is not an API error and leaves already-written bounded cache entries usable. |
| `GET /api/cache/stats` | None | Returns only the authenticated user's remote cache counts/size. The response never includes an absolute host cache path. | JWT required; it must not reveal another user's chapter count, filename, or root. |
| `DELETE /api/cache` | None | Clears only the authenticated user's remote chapter-cache references in a transaction, then removes only cache files left unreferenced by all chapter rows; emits a current-user shelf refresh after commit. | JWT required; no other user's database cache state or still-referenced file may be removed. |
| `POST /api/books/export` | `{ "bookIds": number[], "format": "txt"\|"epub"\|"json" }` | A single local book returns its archived original file. Remote books retain TXT/EPUB export. JSON and multi-book ZIP are explicit OpenReader extensions and remain user-scoped/bounded. | JWT required. Empty/foreign-only selections are client errors; safe `Content-Disposition` names must not expose host paths. |
| `POST /api/books/:id/refresh`, `POST /api/books/:id/refresh-local`, `POST /api/books/:id/change-source` | Existing route bodies | Replace chapter rows atomically. Only after commit, prune superseded derived caches while preserving `OriginalFile`, `chapters.json`, `bookSource.json`, local-store/WebDAV source files, and valid progress/bookmark recovery. Broadcast the merged shelf item after durable writes. | Owner only. Parse/fetch errors leave current catalogue/cache metadata usable and do not delete source files. |

The upstream uses namespace-specific JSON storage and SSE cache progress. OpenReader's REST/SQLite adaptation is allowed only where it preserves the visible action semantics, current-user isolation, durable event ordering, and bounded resource use described above.

## EPUB reader resource contract

### Authenticated chapter response

`GET /api/books/:id/chapters/:index/content`

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| Method/path | Existing `GET /api/books/:id/chapters/:index/content`; no path change. |
| Auth | Existing `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` requirement. The book lookup remains scoped to the authenticated user. |
| Request | Existing numeric book ID and zero-based chapter index. |
| Text response | `200` JSON keeps `chapter` and `content`; adds `"format": "text"`. |
| EPUB response | `200` JSON keeps `chapter` and searchable plain-text `content`; adds `"format": "epub"`, `resourceUrl`, and RFC3339 `resourceExpiresAt`. |
| Side effects | For EPUB, may safely extract/rebuild a derived resource tree and backfill the chapter's canonical `resourcePath`. It must not alter the archived source EPUB. |
| `400` | Invalid book/chapter parameter. |
| `404` | Book/chapter/source archive is not available to the current user. |
| `422` | EPUB exists but is corrupt, unsafe, unsupported, or exceeds extraction limits. |
| `500` | Unexpected persistence or filesystem failure. |
| Error body | `{ "error": "<stable client-safe message>" }`; never include a host filesystem path or token. |

The EPUB additions are backward-compatible JSON fields. Existing clients that only consume `chapter` and `content` continue to work.

Example:

```json
{
  "chapter": {
    "id": 7,
    "bookId": 3,
    "index": 0,
    "title": "第一章"
  },
  "content": "第一章\n正文……",
  "format": "epub",
  "resourceUrl": "/api/epub-resource/<capability>/OEBPS/chapter-1.xhtml",
  "resourceExpiresAt": "2026-07-06T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Capability-protected EPUB resources

`GET /api/epub-resource/:capability/*resourcePath`

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| Auth | Does not accept or require the login Bearer token. Authorization is the signed path capability returned by the protected chapter endpoint. |
| Capability scope | One user ID, one book ID, one source fingerprint/extracted version, read-only access, and a bounded expiration. It is signed with a purpose-separated key derived from `OPENREADER_JWT_SECRET`; it is never interchangeable with a login JWT. |
| Path | `resourcePath` is URL-decoded once, normalized as an EPUB POSIX path, and resolved strictly below that book/version's derived extraction root. |
| Success | `200` with a supported XHTML/HTML, CSS, image, SVG, or font MIME type. `HEAD` may return the same headers without a body. |
| XHTML | Dynamically receives the OpenReader iframe bridge and restrictive security headers. The archived/extracted source file is not modified in place. |
| Relative assets | The capability remains a stable path segment so relative chapter CSS/image/font/link URLs stay within the same authorized root. |
| `400` | Malformed capability or unsafe/malformed resource path. |
| `403` | Invalid signature, expired capability, wrong purpose, wrong archive version, or book ownership no longer matches. |
| `404` | Scoped book/resource no longer exists. |
| `415` | Resource media type is not on the EPUB reader allowlist. |
| Error body | JSON for API-style failures. Iframe failures remain non-blank because the parent detects the resource load failure and displays the reader retry state. |

Security headers include at minimum:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`;
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`;
- a CSP that permits only the injected bridge script and same-capability local styles/images/fonts/data resources;
- no permissive cross-origin credential policy.

The route must not log the capability value. Application access logs should redact the capability path segment.

## CBZ reader resource contract

### Authenticated chapter response

`GET /api/books/:id/chapters/:index/content`

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| Method/path | Existing `GET /api/books/:id/chapters/:index/content`; no path change. |
| Auth | Existing `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` requirement. The book lookup remains scoped to the authenticated user. |
| Request | Existing numeric book ID and zero-based chapter index. |
| CBZ response | `200` JSON keeps `chapter` and `content`; adds `"format": "cbz"`, `resourceUrl`, and RFC3339 `resourceExpiresAt`. `content` remains compatible with the upstream image chapter shape and contains an `<img>` tag pointing at `resourceUrl`. |
| Side effects | May verify/recover the chapter `resourcePath` from the preserved archive. It must not modify the original CBZ archive. |
| `400` | Invalid book/chapter parameter or unsafe archive path. |
| `404` | Book/chapter/source archive/page is not available to the current user. |
| `415` | The selected CBZ entry is not a supported image media type. |
| `422` | CBZ exists but is corrupt, unsafe, unsupported, or exceeds parser/resource limits. |
| `500` | Unexpected persistence or filesystem failure. |
| Error body | `{ "error": "<stable client-safe message>" }`; never include a host filesystem path or token. |

The CBZ additions are backward-compatible JSON fields. Existing clients that only consume `content` will see upstream-style image HTML.

Example:

```json
{
  "chapter": {
    "id": 9,
    "bookId": 4,
    "index": 0,
    "title": "001.jpg",
    "resourcePath": "pages/001.jpg"
  },
  "content": "<img src=\"/api/cbz-resource/<capability>/pages/001.jpg\" />",
  "format": "cbz",
  "resourceUrl": "/api/cbz-resource/<capability>/pages/001.jpg",
  "resourceExpiresAt": "2026-07-06T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Capability-protected CBZ image resources

`GET /api/cbz-resource/:capability/*resourcePath`

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| Auth | Does not accept or require the login Bearer token. Authorization is the signed path capability returned by the protected chapter endpoint. |
| Capability scope | One user ID, one book ID, one source fingerprint, read-only access, and a bounded expiration. It is signed with a purpose-separated key derived from `OPENREADER_JWT_SECRET`; it is never interchangeable with a login JWT or EPUB capability. |
| Path | `resourcePath` is URL-decoded once, normalized as a ZIP/POSIX path, and resolved strictly to an image entry inside that book's preserved CBZ archive. |
| Success | `200` with a supported image MIME type. `HEAD` may return the same headers without a body. |
| `400` | Malformed capability or unsafe/malformed resource path. |
| `403` | Invalid signature, expired capability, wrong purpose, wrong archive fingerprint, or book ownership no longer matches. |
| `404` | Scoped book/resource no longer exists. |
| `415` | Resource media type is not on the CBZ image allowlist. |
| Error body | JSON for handled failures. Reader displays a retryable chapter error rather than a blank page when the image cannot be resolved. |

Security headers include at minimum:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`;
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`;
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`;
- private short-lived cache headers.

The route must not log the capability value. Application access logs should redact the capability path segment.

## Audio reader resource contract

### Authenticated chapter response

`GET /api/books/:id/chapters/:index/content`

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| Method/path | Existing `GET /api/books/:id/chapters/:index/content`; no path change. |
| Auth | Existing `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` requirement. The book lookup remains scoped to the authenticated user. |
| Detection | Audio reading applies to books whose `type` is `1`, matching upstream `readingBook.type === 1`. |
| Audio response | `200` JSON keeps `chapter` and `content`; adds `"format": "audio"`, `resourceUrl`, and RFC3339 `resourceExpiresAt`. `content` remains the same audio URL string for clients that already read it directly. |
| Resource source | For remote audio chapters, the audio URL may remain a source-provided HTTP(S) URL if it is already safe for direct browser playback. For local/private library audio, return a same-origin signed resource URL. |
| Side effects | No text cache rewrite is required. Progress writes store the current playback second as the chapter offset, matching upstream `durChapterPos` behavior. |
| `400` | Invalid book/chapter parameter, unsafe audio URL, or malformed local resource path. |
| `404` | Book/chapter/source audio is not available to the current user. |
| `415` | Resource media type is not on the audio allowlist. |
| `500` | Unexpected persistence, source, or filesystem failure. |
| Error body | `{ "error": "<stable client-safe message>" }`; never include host filesystem paths, signed tokens, cookies, or source credentials. |

Example:

```json
{
  "chapter": {
    "id": 12,
    "bookId": 5,
    "index": 0,
    "title": "第一集"
  },
  "content": "/api/audio-resource/<capability>/tracks/001.mp3",
  "format": "audio",
  "resourceUrl": "/api/audio-resource/<capability>/tracks/001.mp3",
  "resourceExpiresAt": "2026-07-07T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Capability-protected local audio resources

`GET /api/audio-resource/:capability/*resourcePath`

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| Auth | Does not accept or require the login Bearer token. Authorization is the signed path capability returned by the protected chapter endpoint. |
| Capability scope | One user ID, one book ID, one source fingerprint, read-only access, and a bounded expiration. It is signed with a purpose-separated key derived from `OPENREADER_JWT_SECRET`; it is not interchangeable with login, EPUB, or CBZ capabilities. |
| Path | `resourcePath` is URL-decoded once, normalized, and resolved strictly below that book's local library root or approved archive-derived resource root. |
| Local chapter resolution | A local/private audio chapter may identify its media file through chapter content, `chapter.url`, or `chapter.resourcePath`. Absolute filesystem paths and relative paths are accepted only after they resolve under the authenticated book's library root. Remote HTTP(S) URLs continue to use the safe direct remote contract above. |
| Success | `200` with a supported audio MIME type. `HEAD` returns the same client-relevant headers without a body. Byte-range requests return `206` with `Content-Range` when serving local files so browsers can seek efficiently. |
| `400` | Malformed capability or unsafe/malformed resource path. |
| `403` | Invalid signature, expired capability, wrong purpose, wrong source fingerprint, or book ownership no longer matches. |
| `404` | Scoped book/resource no longer exists. |
| `415` | Resource media type is not on the audio allowlist. |

Security headers include at minimum:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`;
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`;
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`;
- private short-lived cache headers.

Remote audio URLs must be validated before they are returned to the browser: only HTTP(S), no embedded credentials, no JavaScript/data/file schemes, and no server-side credential leakage.

Implementation tests must cover:

- remote HTTP(S) audio remains unchanged and does not leak the login JWT;
- local/private audio chapter responses return `/api/audio-resource/<capability>/<path>`;
- `GET`, `HEAD`, and `Range` requests serve only allow-listed audio media under the scoped book library root;
- modified, expired, wrong-purpose, wrong-user/book, traversal, missing-file, and unsupported-media requests fail with client-safe errors;
- access logs redact `/api/audio-resource/<capability>/...` the same way EPUB/CBZ resource capabilities are redacted.

## WebDAV contract

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/webdav/*path` | List/download. |
| `PUT` | `/webdav/*path` | Upload/write. |
| `MKCOL` | `/webdav/*path` | Create directory. |
| `MOVE` | `/webdav/*path` | Rename/move. |
| `DELETE` | `/webdav/*path` | Delete. |

WebDAV paths must be normalized, rooted, and protected from traversal. Every raw WebDAV method requires the standard `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header: missing/invalid credentials return `401` before filesystem access; an authenticated user whose `canAccessStore` is false receives `403` before path parsing or file mutation. The browser uses header-based authenticated requests and must never append a JWT to a download URL.

## Workspace storage access contract

`/api/local-store*`, `/api/webdav/import*`, and `/api/backup/*` require the same authenticated `canAccessStore` capability. A missing/invalid token returns `401`; a disabled capability returns `403`; handlers must perform that check before validating a supplied path, parsing a multipart body, reading an archive, or creating a backup.

Storage resolves without destructive migration: administrators continue to use the existing LocalStore/WebDAV roots so mounted legacy files remain readable; regular users resolve below `users/<safe-username>/` within the same mounts. Generated backup list/download/restore follows that same scope, and scheduled backups are generated per user. Direct LocalStore/WebDAV imports may carry a user-scoped `importToken` returned by preview; on confirmation it authoritatively selects the immutable staged bytes rather than rereading the mutable storage path.

## Bookmark contract

| Method / path | Request | Success / side effects | Auth and errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/books/:id/bookmarks` | None | Lists the caller-owned book's independent bookmarks in stable `id ASC` creation order. | JWT and book ownership required; foreign/missing book is `404`. |
| `POST /api/books/:id/bookmarks` | Reader location plus non-empty `excerpt`/paragraph context and optional `chapterId`. | Creates one immutable location/context record and broadcasts after the durable write. Numeric position fields are normalized. | JWT/current-book required; empty context, oversize data, and a chapter belonging to another book are `400`. |
| `POST /api/books/:id/bookmarks/batch` | Array of the same payload shape. | Validates every row before one transaction; request order becomes creation order and a bad row leaves no valid prefix behind. | JWT/current-book required; empty/malformed batches or any invalid row return `400`. |
| `PUT /api/bookmarks/:id` | `{ "note": string }` | Edits the note only; the original book, chapter, offset, title, and paragraph context remain unchanged. | JWT/current-user required; absent row `404`, oversize note `400`. |
| Backup / restore `bookmarks.json` | Existing JSON shape, including `bookTitle` and `bookUrl`. | Exports ID/creation order; restores modern timestamped rows idempotently without merging independent same-location bookmarks, and remaps a matching destination chapter by index. | Per-user restore scope applies. Legacy rows without timestamps remain readable through the narrow fallback identity. |

## Reader book-content search contract

| Method / path | Request | Success / side effects | Auth and errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/books/:id/search` | `q` (or legacy `keyword`), optional `paged`, `lastIndex`, `chapterLimit`, `matchLimit`, `scanUntilMatch`, and local/remote work bounds. | Lists caller-owned book matches in source chapter order. A cursor always represents the last fully scanned chapter: all matches from that final chapter are returned before a later request can start at its successor. Response preserves `{ list, lastIndex, hasMore, total }` and additionally reports explicit `incomplete`, `unavailableChapters`, and `truncated` states. | JWT/current-book required; blank query `400`, foreign/missing book `404`. Request cancellation stops remote fetch scheduling without writing a false successful result. A returned incomplete page is `200` with a client-safe state, not a host/source error. |
| `GET` / `POST /api/reader3/searchBookContent` | Existing `url`/`bookUrl`, `keyword`, `lastIndex`, `size` aliases. | Keeps legacy `{ isSuccess, data: { list, lastIndex, hasMore, total } }` response and upstream URL lookup behavior. Additive `incomplete`, `unavailableChapters`, and `truncated` data fields expose a safety-bound partial scan without breaking existing clients. | JWT required; legacy validation errors remain `isSuccess: false` messages for deployed Reader3 clients. |

OpenReader retains bounded remote/local scanning and case-insensitive normalized matching as runtime/security adaptations. A bound may never silently advance `lastIndex` past omitted same-chapter matches: it must set `truncated: true`, and the UI must say that results are incomplete. Unavailable remote content is likewise surfaced by `incomplete/unavailableChapters` rather than as a false “没有匹配内容”.

## Compatibility rule

If a refactor changes frontend routes, API paths should stay stable unless an old path is kept as a redirect/shim. Document removals before deleting compatibility behavior.
