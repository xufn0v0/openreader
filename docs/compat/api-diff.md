# Reader-dev vs OpenReader API Diff

Status: initial scaffold.

Reader-dev is a Java/Spring + Vue 2 application. OpenReader is a Go/Gin + Vue 3 rewrite with JWT multi-user auth and a single-container runtime. Exact endpoint-by-endpoint extraction is still required per module before backend refactors.

## Known intentional OpenReader additions

| Area | OpenReader behavior | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | JWT login/register and `/api/me`. | Multi-user self-hosted deployment. |
| Health | `/api/health` exposes runtime/build metadata. | Docker and support diagnostics. |
| Volumes | `data/`, `cache/`, `library/`. | Stable single-container persistence. |
| Legacy shim | `/api/reader3/searchBookContent`. | Preserve reader3-compatible search behavior for migrated UI/API clients. |

## Book-source ownership correction

The deployed OpenReader REST paths remain stable, but their previous global-table semantics are a `must-fix`, not
an intentional JWT adaptation. Reader-dev resolves `bookSource.json` below each user namespace; therefore
`/api/sources*`, debug, search/explore, Reader, scheduler, backup and admin counts must all use authenticated-user
associations. Shared rows created by the additive migration are storage deduplication only and must use
copy-on-write. Full route/status/error compatibility is recorded in
`book-source-ownership-p2-contract.md` and `api-contract.md`.

Implementation status on 2026-07-27: source management/debug, search, explore, remote-book, Reader
content/cache, scheduler and administrator count/default/reset/delete consumers are association-scoped.
Backup/WebDAV restore and the browser/release gates remain open and keep the module from release-complete status.

## Required extraction before backend changes

For each module, record:

- reader-dev method/path/query/body/status/response;
- OpenReader method/path/query/body/status/response;
- whether the difference is `must-fix`, `acceptable-change`, `intentional-redesign`, or `unknown`;
- test file covering the contract.

## Priority modules

1. Reader content/progress/bookmarks.
2. Source search/catalog/chapter content.
3. Local import preview/import.
4. Book management/category/batch operations.
5. Backup/WebDAV/local store.
