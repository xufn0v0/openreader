# Reader iPad / wide-touch responsive P0 contract

Date: 2026-07-19

Fixed upstream: `changshengyu/reader-dev@fa22f271849d45f93349ae1636223e27b16a4691`

This pass reopens the iPad conclusion recorded for `b8b70f9`. That commit fixed a split state in
which OpenReader mounted mobile panels at iPad widths while mobile CSS remained hidden behind a
`750px` media query. It did not verify whether a wide iPad should have entered the mobile scene in
the first place. The reported iPad Pro failure shows that this distinction is user-visible: the
content-sized mobile settings and other primary panels occupy the upper part of the wide tablet,
and the expected desktop close/switch controls are replaced by the mobile interaction.

## Fixed-upstream evidence

- `web/src/plugins/helper.js#isMiniInterface()` returns only `window.innerWidth <= 750`.
- `web/src/App.vue` calls that function on startup and resize and commits the result through
  `setMiniInterface`.
- `web/src/plugins/vuex.js#setMiniInterface` uses that width result for adaptive mode; a
  non-adaptive page mode forces mini mode.
- `web/src/views/Reader.vue` therefore uses desktop rails and desktop popovers at iPad Pro CSS
  widths such as `1024` and `1366`; the four full-width mini popovers are only used at `750px` or
  below (or when the user explicitly forces the mobile page mode).
- Upstream `ReadSettings.vue` independently bounds the settings list at `45vh`; shelf, source and
  catalog use a `300px` inner scroll region.

## Current-state audit before implementation

| Contract | Fixed upstream | Current OpenReader | Classification / action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adaptive breakpoint | Width-only, `window.innerWidth <= 750`. | `isMobileLikeViewport()` returns true for any mobile UA and for `MacIntel + maxTouchPoints > 1`, regardless of width. | **must-fix**: adaptive mode must be width-only. A wide iPad must not be forced into the mobile Reader or fullscreen workspace dialogs. |
| Explicit mobile mode | A non-adaptive page mode forces mini mode. | Persisted `pageMode === 'mobile'` forces mini mode. | **allowed runtime mapping / must-preserve**: users may explicitly request phone mode on an iPad. |
| Reader at 1024/1366px | Desktop rails, desktop progress and desktop primary popovers. | Mobile top/bottom chrome and full-width, top-anchored primary panels. | **wrong scene selection**: this is the direct cause of the reported upper-half overlay behavior. |
| Other dialogs at 1024/1366px | Non-fullscreen dialogs because mini mode is false. | `GlobalOverlayHost`, BookInfo, edit dialogs and SourceManager all consume the same UA-driven mini state and can become fullscreen/mobile on iPad. | **must-fix through the shared responsive predicate**, not one-off dialog CSS. |
| Narrow phone / narrow split view | Mini mode at `<=750px`. | Mini mode at `<=750px`. | **must-preserve** at 390×844, 360×800 and a 750px boundary. |
| Orientation / resize | Recomputed from current width. | Recomputed from current width, but UA keeps iPad permanently mini. | **must-fix**: 1024↔750 boundary changes scene once per resize without leaving both desktop and mobile controls mounted. |
| Mobile primary content bounds | Settings list `45vh`; shelf/source/catalog inner list `300px`. | Same inner bounds, but primary root/body use visible overflow. | **separate hardening**: phone-mode content must remain within the dynamic viewport and retain a reliable close path; this does not justify classifying a wide adaptive iPad as mobile. |

## Test-first requirements

1. Unit contract for the shared responsive predicate:
   - adaptive/automatic mode is desktop at `751`, `1024` and `1366` even with an iPad UA/touch;
   - adaptive mode is mobile at `750`, `390` and `360`;
   - explicit `mobile` mode remains mobile at `1024` and `1366`.
2. Replace the existing source test that encodes “wide iPad must be mini”; a regression test must
   instead lock the single shared width predicate used by Reader, Index and global dialogs.
3. Real-browser iPad Pro portrait `1024×1366` and landscape `1366×1024`, iPad UA + touch:
   - adaptive mode mounts desktop rails/progress and no mobile chrome;
   - shelf, source, catalog and settings open as bounded desktop workspaces and close from their
     visible desktop tool/close controls;
   - bookmark, search and BookInfo are bounded non-fullscreen dialogs with visible close controls;
   - no panel exceeds the visual viewport or creates horizontal overflow.
4. Real-browser 390×844 and 360×800 must retain the mobile toolbar, full-width primary panels,
   same-tool close, click-away close, scroll ownership and symmetric 16px text margins.
5. Explicit mobile mode at 1024×1366 must still mount the coherent mobile scene and every primary
   panel must remain closable. This is an allowed user-selected difference, not adaptive behavior.

## Implementation boundary

- Change the shared responsive decision; do not add iPad-specific CSS or UA exceptions to each
  Reader/dialog component.
- Preserve stored settings, routes, reading progress and all content-format behavior.
- The earlier semantic `mini-interface` class fix remains useful for explicit mobile mode at wide
  widths and must not be reverted.
- If phone-mode panel overflow is reproduced after the scene-selection fix, bound the common
  workspace root/body and keep scrolling inside the panel; do not hide the close control.

## Implementation and release evidence

Completed on 2026-07-19 in `39a5244`:

- `isMobileLikeViewport()` is now the fixed-upstream width-only `<=750px` decision. The shared
  `shouldUseMiniInterface()` still lets an explicit persisted `mobile` mode force the coherent
  phone scene at a wide tablet width.
- Reader, Index, BookInfo, BookEdit, global overlays and SourceManager continue to consume that
  one shared decision; no iPad-specific component CSS or UA exception was added.
- The responsive contract was replaced test-first. The full frontend suite passed `503/503`, the
  full Go suite passed, and the production frontend build passed.
- The real-browser contract passed at adaptive iPad Pro portrait `1024x1366`, landscape
  `1366x1024`, phone `390x844` and `360x800`, plus explicit mobile mode at `1024x1366`. It opened
  and closed all four primary Reader panels and the bookmark, search and BookInfo dialogs while
  checking that their close controls remained visible.
- The image was built locally from a clean detached worktree so the unfinished WebDAV P2 draft was
  not included. New-volume portable backup and historical TXT/EPUB/UMD/CBZ, relative-cache and
  owner-isolation gates passed before upload.
- Published tags: `ghcr.io/changshengyu/openreader:39a5244` and `latest`. Both resolve to OCI index

## 2026-07-19 close-path regression addendum

The scene-selection result above remains valid, but the claimed “all panels close” evidence was
incomplete: it exercised the active rail/tool button and did not exercise a touch outside the
panel. A real iPad Pro report exposed the missing visible close target and the unverified stacking
order between the desktop dismiss surface and Reader click zones. The focused correction and test gate are recorded in
[`reader-ipad-panel-dismiss-p0-contract.md`](reader-ipad-panel-dismiss-p0-contract.md); release
`39a5244` must not be cited as evidence for the outside-touch path.
