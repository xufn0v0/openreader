# Reader-dev vs OpenReader Gap Analysis

Baseline: `changshengyu/reader-dev@fa22f271849d45f93349ae1636223e27b16a4691`.

Local upstream checkout used for this pass: `/private/tmp/changshengyu-reader-dev`.

Status labels:

- `must-fix`: required to match upstream/user-visible behavior or avoid known bug.
- `acceptable-change`: allowed technical adaptation or explicit user-requested improvement.
- `intentional-redesign`: deliberate OpenReader runtime/product difference that remains compatible.
- `unknown`: needs deeper extraction before implementation.

## Summary

The current risk is not framework selection. The risk is implementing from an abstract “match upstream” prompt instead of a verifiable upstream behavior contract. Future module work must extract upstream behavior first, then implement OpenReader changes against that contract.

## Module matrix

| Module | reader-dev original behavior/files | OpenReader current behavior/files | Difference/risk | Status | Recommended tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend scene structure | `web/src/views/Index.vue`, `web/src/views/Reader.vue`; router has `/` and `/reader`. | `frontend/src/router/index.js` splits `/`, `/search`, `/discover`, `/local-store`, `/sources`, `/settings`, `/books/:id`, `/books/:id/read`. | Current route/page split fragments upstream workspace flows. Old URLs may stay as redirects, but product structure should converge to Index + Reader. | `must-fix` for P1 | Router redirect tests; browser flow search → BookInfo → read. |
| Reader mobile toolbar state | `web/src/views/Reader.vue`: `showToolBar: true`; center tap toggles; panel open branches return without hiding toolbar. | `frontend/src/views/Reader.vue`: `mobileChromeVisible = ref(false)`; `useReaderTools` and `useReaderPanels` hide chrome on panel actions. | Directly causes mobile reader mismatch and blank/operation confusion reports. | `must-fix` for P0 | Contract tests for default visible and panel coexistence; mobile browser smoke. |
| Reader mobile panel structure | Upstream uses Element popovers with `popper-class="popper-component"`; mini interface popper is full-width and coexists with toolbar. | Current reader uses multiple mobile bottom `el-drawer` instances. | Drawer architecture changes z-index, hit testing, toolbar coexistence, and upstream layout. | `must-fix` for P0 | Browser tests for settings/catalog/source/shelf panel + toolbar visible. |
| Reader mobile content geometry | Upstream mini `.chapter` uses `width: 100vw`, `padding: 0 16px`, `box-sizing: border-box`, `text-align: justify`; slide mode also uses 16px content margins. | Current mobile CSS uses `padding: 42px 22px ...`; paragraph justification/spacing does not fully match upstream. | Causes asymmetric left/right whitespace and paragraph layout drift. | `must-fix` for P0 | DOM geometry probe for left/right padding within 1px across 390×844 and 360×800. |
| Reader scrolling vs click paging | Upstream has page/scroll modes with discrete click navigation. | User requested continuous native finger/wheel scrolling while click paging remains segmented. | Intentional UX improvement if it does not change mode selection semantics. | `acceptable-change` | Browser scroll continuity probe; click paging regression tests. |
| Reader settings controls | Upstream uses controls that are easier to distinguish visually; user requested minus/value/plus controls instead of current easy-to-mis-tap slider behavior. | Current setting stepper exists but must be rechecked against upstream layout/state. | Allowed UX adaptation, but values/defaults/state must match upstream. | `acceptable-change` | Unit tests for value bounds; browser setting interaction test. |
| Reader content formats | Upstream `Content.vue` handles text, images/comic-like content, EPUB iframe documents, audio-related branches, and cross-chapter behavior. | Current `ReaderChapterContent.vue` handles text/images/volume blocks and the rebuilt EPUB iframe branch; continuous chapter retention, extension, anchor, error, and explicit-jump behavior now follows the extracted fixed-baseline contract. | EPUB, image/CBZ rendering, and continuous cross-chapter behavior are implemented and browser-validated. Audio/TTS still needs a separate extraction; CBZ archive/import edges remain. | `aligned` for implemented formats; `unknown` for audio/TTS and CBZ archive edges | Keep EPUB/image/continuous browser contracts; add separate audio/TTS and CBZ archive fixtures. |
| BookInfo | Upstream has one `web/src/components/BookInfo.vue` used from workspace flows. | Current has `BookDetail.vue`, `BookInfoDialog.vue`, `BookInfoPanel.vue`, `OverlayBookInfo.vue`. | Duplicate logic risks inconsistent actions/search/read/source behavior. | `must-fix` for P1 | Single BookInfo action contract; search/shelf/reader reuse tests. |
| Bookshelf/BookManage/BookGroup | Upstream: `BookShelf.vue`, `BookManage.vue`, `BookGroup.vue` under Index workspace. | Current: `Home.vue`, overlay management components, categories/store utilities. | Some enhancements may be valid, but workflow and mobile sidebar behavior need upstream comparison. | `unknown` | Workspace browser flows; category/order tests. |
| Mobile Index sidebar | Upstream sidebar width/drag/fixed bottom buttons must be extracted from `Index.vue` and related CSS. | Current `AppLayout.vue` and mobile navigation had reported drag/fixed-button mismatch. | User-visible mismatch: GitHub/day-night buttons should not slide with drawer content. | `must-fix` for P1 | Mobile drag smoke; fixed-bottom button geometry probe. |
| Search/explore/source flow | Upstream Index integrates search/explore/source and BookInfo transitions. | Current has separate `Search.vue`, `Discover.vue`, `Sources.vue` pages. | Flow fragmentation can change API order, panel state, and back behavior. | `must-fix` for P1 | Search → result group → BookInfo → add/read browser test. |
| Online source parsing | Upstream reader3-compatible source semantics live across web components and Java backend. | Current Go parser in `backend/engine/source_*` has tests and compatibility shims. | Must continue fixture-based extraction; do not infer equivalence from passing current tests alone. | `unknown` | HTML fixture/golden tests for search/info/toc/content. |
| Local import catalog parsing | Upstream behavior needs deterministic catalog extraction independent of network. | Current staged upload token flow reduces repeated upload/network dependency. | Staged token is acceptable enhancement; catalog detection still needs upstream fixture comparison. | `acceptable-change` + `unknown` | TXT/EPUB/Markdown/PDF/UMD fixture tests; reparse without upload test. |
| Replace rules/content cleanup | Upstream `ReplaceRule.vue` and backend semantics need extraction. | Current Go endpoints and overlays exist. | Rule ordering, scope, and test output may differ. | `unknown` | Golden rule application tests; UI batch action tests. |
| RSS | Upstream `RssSourceList.vue`, `RssArticleList.vue`, `RssArticle.vue`. | Current `RSSManager.vue`, overlays, Go RSS parser. | UI and parser semantics need mapping. | `unknown` | RSS fixture parser tests; source/article browser smoke. |
| WebDAV/local store | Upstream `WebDAV.vue`, `LocalStore.vue` and server storage behavior. | Current Go WebDAV/local-store endpoints and browser component exist. | Path safety and workflow compatibility both need explicit contract. | `unknown` | Path traversal tests; upload/list/import browser smoke; Docker volume smoke. |
| Backup/restore | Upstream backup flows and reader-dev formats require extraction. | Current OpenReader backup service and Legado restore exist. | Must preserve OpenReader data and document reader-dev/Legado import semantics. | `unknown` | Restore testdata; backup list/download/restore tests. |
| Auth/user management | Upstream user management components include `AddUser.vue`, `UserManage.vue`; OpenReader adds JWT. | Current JWT/multi-user/admin endpoints are intentional runtime adaptation. | Auth model differs intentionally, but UI/workspace placement and permission behavior need checks. | `intentional-redesign` + `unknown` | Auth dialog and admin browser smoke; user-scope API tests. |
| Docker/runtime | Upstream ships Java/Gradle/Docker variants. | Current single Go binary + frontend dist in Alpine, env-driven volumes. | Intentional deployment redesign. Must preserve local Docker build and volume compatibility. | `intentional-redesign` | `PUSH=0 ./scripts/docker-build-push.sh`; `scripts/docker-volume-backup-smoke.sh`. |

## Immediate P0 contract: Reader mobile

| Behavior | Upstream evidence | Current evidence | Required action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool layer default | `Reader.vue` data contains `showToolBar: true`. | `Reader.vue` contains `mobileChromeVisible = ref(false)`. | Set mobile toolbar default to visible and test it. |
| Panel open | Upstream click handler returns when popovers/settings are visible; opening a panel does not hide `showToolBar`. | `useReaderTools.openMobileTool` and `useReaderPanels` set `mobileChromeVisible.value = false`. | Remove panel/action coupling to toolbar visibility. |
| Mobile panel container | Upstream mobile popper is full-width via `.popper-component`. | Current mobile uses bottom drawers for shelf/toc/source/settings/search/cache/bookmark. | Rebuild mobile panels as toolbar-coexisting popovers/workspaces. |
| Horizontal layout | Upstream mini chapter padding is 16px and justified. | Current mobile content padding is 22px with altered vertical padding. | Restore upstream 16px geometry and paragraph semantics. |
| Tests | Upstream behavior is source contract. | Existing tests assert toolbar hides after panel actions. | Delete/rewrite conflicting tests. |

### 2026-07-06 implementation note

Implemented in commit work following this contract:

- Mobile reader tool layer now defaults to visible and initial chapter loading no longer hides it.
- Opening reader tools/panels no longer forces the mobile tool layer closed.
- Mobile shelf, catalog, bookmark, search, source, cache, and settings panels now use a toolbar-coexisting full-width workspace instead of visible bottom `el-drawer`.
- Settings panel coexistence, no visible mobile drawer, center tap behavior, and 16px mobile reader geometry are covered by `scripts/smoke/reader-mobile-contract.mjs`.
- Ordinary text rendering now preserves safe upstream inline HTML semantics via sanitized `v-html`, while keeping plain text for search/progress.
- Image markup now marks chapters with upstream comic semantics, and CBZ-like book URLs hide the chapter title to match upstream `Content.vue`.
- Unit tests that previously encoded “panel open hides toolbar” were rewritten.
- EPUB document reading now uses a dedicated iframe/resource branch that preserves XHTML, relative CSS/images/fonts, hash links, cross-document links, and upstream bridge events.
- EPUB resources are served through scoped, expiring capabilities instead of exposing the login JWT to iframe/resource requests.
- The EPUB browser contract is covered by `scripts/smoke/reader-epub-contract.mjs` at 1440×900, 390×844, and 360×800.

Still pending in Reader P0:

- Complete separate `Content.vue` parity reviews for CBZ import/archive edge cases and audio/TTS media controls.
- The final Reader P0 acceptance image remains pending. Intermediate validation image `ca43409` has been published and is not the final Reader P0 release.

## Immediate P0 contract: continuous cross-chapter reading

Status: implemented and validated on 2026-07-06.

This contract is tied to `changshengyu/reader-dev@fa22f271849d45f93349ae1636223e27b16a4691`. It replaces earlier audit notes and tests that treated a fixed previous-1/next-2 window as upstream behavior.

### Upstream state and transition contract

| Concern | Fixed upstream evidence | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Mode eligibility | `Reader.vue.isScrollRead` is true only for `上下滚动` and `上下滚动2`, and false for EPUB, audio, and slide/page branches. | Only `scroll` and `scroll2` render a multi-chapter text/image list. EPUB/audio/page/flip keep their dedicated branches. |
| Initial state | `data()` initializes `scrollStartChapterIndex = 0`, `showNextChapterSize = 1`, and `showPrevChapterSize = 0`. Entering a scroll mode sets `scrollStartChapterIndex = chapterIndex`. | The first continuous window starts at the current chapter and contains at most the current chapter plus one following chapter. It must not eagerly prepend a previous chapter or load two following chapters. |
| `上下滚动` retention | `computeShowChapterList()` starts from `scrollStartChapterIndex`; that value remains the explicitly entered/jumped chapter while natural scrolling updates `readingBook.index`. | Ordinary `scroll` accumulates already-rendered chapters from the explicit start chapter while appending forward. Natural scrolling must not silently discard earlier chapters. |
| `上下滚动2` retention | `computeShowChapterList()` overrides its start with `chapterIndex - showPrevChapterSize`; the fixed baseline keeps `showPrevChapterSize = 0`. The settings text says this mode automatically hides read chapters. | `scroll2` starts at the current visible chapter after chapter progress advances, so already-read chapters are removed. It does not retain a synthetic previous chapter. |
| Reverse extension | The top-of-document previous-chapter preload block in `scrollHandler()` is commented out in the fixed baseline. Previous chapter navigation remains available through explicit previous-page/chapter actions, which set a new `scrollStartChapterIndex` and rebuild at the top. | Natural upward scrolling at the top must not prepend a previous chapter. Remove the current `scroll2` top extension and its height compensation. Explicit previous navigation still loads the previous chapter. |
| Forward extension threshold | `scrollHandler()` starts loading when `scrollTop > scrollHeight - 4 * windowHeight`, described as reaching the fourth-to-last page. | Begin extending when the viewport is within approximately four viewport heights of the document bottom. The current later threshold (`scrollTop + viewport > scrollHeight - 2 * viewport`) is not equivalent. |
| Forward extension size | The next index is the last displayed index plus one. `showNextChapterSize` is recalculated as `nextIndex - chapterIndex`, then exactly that adjacent chapter is loaded before recomputing the list. | Add one adjacent chapter per extension transaction, without duplicate requests. In `scroll2`, recomputation may simultaneously remove chapters before the current visible chapter. |
| Extension lock | `preCaching` guards the transaction and progress saving; it is cleared on both success and failure. | Only one boundary extension runs at a time. The lock must release after success or failure, and progress must not be persisted from a transient replacement state. |
| Chapter switch by scrolling | `saveReadingPosition()` chooses the current visible `h3/p`, finds its `.chapter-content[data-index]`, updates `readingBook.index/title`, and persists the chapter index. | Visible-chapter detection updates chapter identity, title, local progress, and server progress from one consistent snapshot. |
| Scroll anchor | Before replacing a changed list, `computeShowChapterList()` captures the current paragraph's chapter index, `data-pos`, and viewport offset, then restores that offset after DOM replacement. | Removing read chapters or appending content must not move the paragraph being read. Clamp the restored scroll position to the actual scroll range. |
| Explicit chapter navigation | `toNextChapter()`/`toLastChapter()` set `scrollStartChapterIndex` to the target and call `computeShowChapterList(true)`; reset mode scrolls to the top. Search/bookmark jumps similarly set the start chapter, rebuild, then locate the target paragraph. | Catalog, search, bookmark, previous, and next actions rebuild around the requested chapter and position. They are distinct from natural boundary extension. |
| Adjacent load failure | `loadShowChapter()` stores a chapter block containing `获取章节内容失败！` and marks it as an error; a later load may replace an error cache entry. | A failed adjacent chapter must not be silently dropped into a blank gap or leave endless invisible retry churn. Render an in-list error block with a retry path, while retaining the currently readable chapter. |
| Book bounds | A missing catalog index rejects as `章节不存在`; extension catches the failure and releases `preCaching`. Explicit next/previous actions show first/last chapter messages. | Never request outside `[0, catalog.length - 1]`. Reaching the book end remains stable and does not keep scheduling extension attempts. |

### Route, persistence, and API mapping

| Layer | Upstream contract | OpenReader adaptation | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Route/jump inputs | Upstream reader events carry `chapterIndex` plus a paragraph/bookmark position. | Keep `/books/:id/read?chapter=&offset=&percent=` and `resume=1`; these are old-link and Go/Vue adaptations. A route jump must enter the same explicit-rebuild transition above. | `acceptable-change` |
| Local position | Upstream stores `bookChapterProgress@{name}_{author}` and the current user's `@readingRecent`; the paragraph offset is relative to the visible chapter. | Keep user-scoped `openreader_chapter_progress@{user}@{bookId}` with chapter index/id, text offset, chapter percent, mode, and timestamp. The visible chapter snapshot must remain internally consistent. | `acceptable-change` |
| Server progress | Upstream posts `/saveBookProgress` with book URL and chapter index while local cache keeps the paragraph offset. | Keep authenticated `PUT /progress` with chapter id/index, offset, chapter/full-book percent, mode, and conflict metadata. This is the Go multi-user data model, not a reason to change the visible transition order. | `intentional-redesign` |
| Chapter content | Upstream calls `getBookContent(chapterIndex, ..., cache=true)` and caches up to three books in memory. | Keep current chapter API and scoped browser memory cache/preload implementation, but boundary extension must expose failures and follow the upstream window policy. | `acceptable-change` |

### OpenReader implementation mapping

| Previous incorrect evidence | Implemented replacement | Classification | Contract test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial `scroll2` window was previous 1/current/next 2. | `readerChapterWindowIndexes()` now begins at the current/explicit start chapter and initially shows only current plus one following chapter. | `aligned` | Book-start, middle, and book-end window tests. |
| `scroll2` retained a synthetic previous chapter and pruned on every scroll event. | Visible chapter identity updates without DOM replacement; the controlled forward-extension transaction removes every read chapter only in `scroll2`, while `scroll` retains its explicit start. | `aligned` | Mode-specific retention and anchored transaction tests. |
| Top proximity automatically prepended the previous chapter. | Natural top scrolling no longer extends backward. Explicit previous/catalog/search/bookmark navigation rebuilds the selected chapter and requested position. | `aligned` | Extension-zone and loaded explicit-navigation tests. |
| Forward extension began within three viewport heights. | `readerChapterWindowExtension()` now uses the fixed upstream `scrollTop > scrollHeight - 4 * clientHeight` boundary. | `aligned` | Exact threshold tests immediately below/above the boundary. |
| Adjacent failures were silently dropped. | A failed adjacent chapter renders an in-list error block with stable chapter position and retry; current content remains readable and the extension lock always releases. | `aligned` plus explicit retry affordance | Failure/retry and serialized-extension tests plus browser failure fixture. |
| Preload and window construction could issue duplicate requests for the same chapter. | `useReaderChapterContent()` deduplicates in-flight requests by book, chapter, and refresh intent. | `acceptable-change` | Concurrent load test and browser request counters. |
| Mode changes held the already-readable current chapter behind a global loading state until adjacent requests finished. | The cached current block renders immediately; only missing adjacent blocks load, and adjacent latency/failure cannot blank the current chapter. | `aligned` | Mode controller and delayed/failing adjacent chapter browser tests. |

### Required implementation gates

1. Replace existing chapter-window tests that assert previous-1/next-2 retention or natural reverse extension.
2. Add state tests for initial load, forward extension, visible chapter advance, `scroll` retention, `scroll2` read-chapter removal, explicit previous navigation, book bounds, and extension lock release.
3. Add a delayed/failing adjacent chapter fixture proving the current chapter remains readable and the error is visible/retryable.
4. Add a real-browser long-book smoke at 1440×900, 390×844, and 360×800. Verify native finger/wheel continuity, no horizontal shift, no anchor jump after `scroll2` cleanup, and no duplicate chapter requests.
5. Preserve the user-requested difference: native touch/wheel scrolling remains continuous, while click zones and keyboard paging keep discrete viewport-sized movement.

Validation evidence:

- Backend `go test ./...`: passed.
- Frontend `npm test`: 261 passed.
- Frontend `npm run build`: passed.
- `scripts/smoke/reader-continuous-contract.mjs`: passed at 1440×900, 390×844, and 360×800, plus a 390×844 adjacent-failure/retry pass.
- The browser contract verifies initial `[current, next]` rendering, native 137px wheel movement, symmetric readable geometry, `scroll2` read-chapter removal, paragraph anchor drift within 2px, no duplicate adjacent requests, current-content survival on failure, and successful retry.
- Existing `scripts/smoke/reader-mobile-contract.mjs` and `scripts/smoke/reader-image-contract.mjs` both passed after this change.

## Immediate P0 contract: Content image/comic/CBZ reading

Status: implemented and validated on 2026-07-06.

### Upstream behavior contract

| Layer | Upstream evidence | Required visible/state behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Image detection | `web/src/components/Content.vue` treats any content line containing `<img` as cartoon/comic content. | OpenReader must detect image markup before stripping/sanitizing text, and mixed text+image lines must preserve their text positions around the image. |
| Image source rewriting | Upstream replaces `src=` with `data-src=` and replaces `__API_ROOT__` with `apiRoot`, then relies on `v-lazy-container`. | OpenReader may use Vue/Element lazy images instead of `v-lazy-container`, but must resolve `src`, `data-src`, `data-original`, `data-url`, and `__API_ROOT__` to the same effective image URL. |
| Comic image layout | Upstream global `.content-body img` forces images to `width: 100%`, `max-width: 100vw`, and `display: block`. | Comic/CBZ images should visually fill the readable content width instead of being capped by a generic prose-image max width. Text illustrations may keep caption/preview behavior only when it does not shrink comic pages. |
| CBZ title handling | Upstream `isCbz` is `readingBook.bookUrl.toLowerCase().endsWith(".cbz")`; CBZ chapters render no chapter title. | OpenReader must treat `.cbz` source/original/local URLs as CBZ and hide the chapter heading for CBZ chapters, including query/hash suffixes. |
| Continuous chapter list | Upstream `renderScrollChapterList()` applies the same image/CBZ rules to every visible chapter in scroll modes. | OpenReader must apply image, comic, and CBZ layout consistently in single chapter, scroll, and scroll2 multi-chapter windows. |
| Image-load pagination | Upstream Reader subscribes to `$Lazyload.$on("loaded", lazyloadHandler)` and `lazyloadHandler()` calls `computePages()` unless audio is active. | When an image finishes loading in OpenReader, flip/page pagination and chapter progress must be recomputed. A late-loading image must not leave stale page counts or wrong scroll restoration. |
| Position/search semantics | Upstream assigns `data-pos` based on the original line offset before converting image tags to lazy markup. Search/TTS paragraph traversal still mostly targets `h3,p`, while image wrappers carry `data-pos`. | OpenReader should preserve source offsets for text/image blocks. Searchable text must not include raw image markup, and image-only CBZ pages must still expose block positions for progress/bookmark calculations. |
| Error/unsafe HTML handling | Upstream directly injects HTML for image lines. | OpenReader must keep its stricter HTML sanitizer and URL allowlist for security; this is an allowed security hardening if the visible safe image behavior remains aligned. |

### Current OpenReader mapping

| Concern | Current evidence | Classification | Required action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Image parsing | `frontend/src/utils/readerContent.js` parses `<img>` into `type: "image"` blocks and reads `src`, `data-src`, `data-original`, `data-url`, including a non-browser parser path for deterministic tests. | `aligned` | Covered by parser contract tests for `__API_ROOT__`, mixed text+image lines, unsafe image URLs, and source positions. |
| CBZ detection | `useReaderChapterPresentation.js` checks `url`, `bookUrl`, `libraryPath`, and `originalFile`, ignoring query/hash. | `acceptable-change` | Keep broader detection because Go/Vue data shape differs from upstream `bookUrl`; document as compatibility adaptation. |
| Image layout | `ReaderChapterContent.vue` keeps the generic illustration cap but overrides comic/CBZ image boxes and image elements to fill the readable column width. | `aligned` | Browser geometry checks cover desktop page mode, mobile continuous scroll, and mobile flip mode. |
| CBZ heading | `hideTitle` is set for CBZ and `h1` is skipped. | `aligned` | Tests cover query/hash `.CBZ`, `originalFile`, and `libraryPath` shapes. |
| Image-load relayout | `ReaderChapterContent.vue` emits `image-load`; Reader calls `updateFlipLayout()` and refreshes progress state after every successful image load. | `aligned` | Static wiring test plus delayed-image browser checks cover page/flip recalculation. |
| Preview | Element Plus image preview is used for ordinary image blocks; the image block stops click propagation before the Reader center-tap handler. | `acceptable-change` | Browser checks prove preview opens without hiding the default-visible mobile toolbar. |
| Security | Current parser strips unsafe inline HTML and rejects non-http(s) image URLs. | `acceptable-change` | Keep the stricter allowlist; tests should prove `javascript:` and script attributes do not survive. |

### Validation evidence

Frontend unit tests:

1. `parseReaderContentBlocks()` resolves `__API_ROOT__`, `src`, `data-src`, `data-original`, and `data-url`, preserving source `pos/endPos`.
2. Mixed text+image+text lines produce text blocks around an image block with stable offsets.
3. Unsafe image URLs and unsafe inline HTML are rejected while safe inline text remains searchable.
4. CBZ detection hides titles for `.cbz`, `.CBZ?x#y`, `originalFile`, and `libraryPath` shapes.
5. Image load events from the content component bubble to Reader layout recomputation without firing for non-image text blocks.

Real-browser gate:

1. Open a fixture reader chapter at 1440×900, 390×844, and 360×800 with delayed-loading images.
2. Confirm comic/CBZ images fill the readable width, CBZ titles are hidden, and ordinary text remains justified with symmetric mobile padding.
3. Confirm image load changes page count/layout rather than leaving stale pagination.
4. Confirm image preview does not hide the mobile toolbar or pass through as a center tap.

Implemented coverage:

- `frontend/tests/readerContent.test.mjs`
- `frontend/tests/readerChapterPresentation.test.mjs`
- `frontend/tests/readerImageWiring.test.mjs`
- `scripts/smoke/reader-image-contract.mjs`

The browser contract covers 1440×900 desktop page mode, 390×844 and 360×800 mobile continuous scroll, plus a separate 390×844 mobile flip-pagination pass.

Repository gate:

- Backend `go test ./...`: passed.
- Frontend `npm test`: 257 passed.
- Frontend `npm run build`: passed.
- Existing `scripts/smoke/reader-mobile-contract.mjs`: passed after the image click-through fix.

## Immediate P0 contract: EPUB document reading

### Upstream behavior contract

| Layer | Upstream evidence | Required visible/state behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Detection | `Content.vue` and `Reader.vue` identify a local EPUB from the `.epub` book URL. | OpenReader may use its current `originalFile`/`libraryPath` model, but only local EPUB books enter this branch. |
| Chapter API | `BookController.getBookContent` extracts the EPUB and returns the XHTML chapter URL instead of flattened text. | Loading an EPUB chapter must preserve its XHTML document, CSS, images, fonts, anchors, and relative resource paths. A missing archive/chapter remains an explicit load error, never a blank reader. |
| Resource serving | `YueduApi.kt` exposes extracted EPUB files under `/epub/*`; HTML responses receive the reader bridge from `BookConfig.epubInjectJavascript`. | The iframe receives a same-origin XHTML resource URL whose relative assets resolve without separate frontend rewriting. |
| Rendering | `Content.vue.renderEpub` renders the chapter in `.epub-iframe`. | EPUB uses a dedicated iframe branch; it must not pass through the ordinary paragraph/image block renderer. |
| Bridge lifecycle | Child emits `inited`, `load`, and `setHeight`; parent sends `setStyle` and `execute`. | On initialization, apply current reader typography and request height. On load, recompute pages and restore position. Height is at least 80% of the viewport and content changes trigger page recalculation. |
| Reader style | Parent injects font family, font size, weight, color, line height, paragraph spacing, hidden scrollbars, and responsive image rules. | Theme and typography changes update the already-open EPUB without reimporting or flattening it. Images remain block-level, within viewport width, and preserve aspect ratio. |
| Input forwarding | Child forwards ordinary clicks and keydown; image clicks emit the full image list/index; in-document hash clicks emit the target rectangle. | Center click follows the Reader toolbar state machine, keyboard navigation remains available, image preview opens at the selected image, and hash links scroll to the target without losing reader chrome state. |
| Linked chapter navigation | Child `load` includes its URL; `Reader.vue.epubLocationChangeHandler` maps a navigated XHTML path back to the catalog index. | Internal links to another spine document update the active chapter/index/title and progress state instead of leaving Reader state stale. |
| Position | `Reader.vue.showPosition` restores document scroll immediately and again after `iframeLoad`; EPUB progress is document `scrollTop`. | Returning to a chapter restores the same vertical position after the iframe has its final height. |
| Content transforms | `Reader.vue.filterContent` and `formatChinese` return EPUB content unchanged. | Do not apply text replacement or simplified/traditional conversion to the XHTML document during rendering. Plain-text search/index data may continue to use the parsed text copy. |
| Parent touch handling | Parent click/touch handlers return early for EPUB because the bridge owns iframe input. | Iframe events must not double-trigger parent touch/click handlers or penetrate open panels. |

### OpenReader API and security adaptation

The Java upstream serves extracted files directly from its data tree. OpenReader adds JWT multi-user isolation, so copying that route literally would expose another user's book or make the iframe return `401` because an iframe navigation cannot attach the Axios Bearer header.

The compatible Go/Vue contract is:

| Contract | Required OpenReader behavior | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| Existing chapter endpoint | `GET /api/books/:id/chapters/:index/content` remains Bearer-authenticated and keeps the existing `chapter` and plain-text `content` fields. It adds `format` (`text` or `epub`) and, for EPUB only, `resourceUrl` plus its expiry metadata. Existing text clients continue to work. | `acceptable-change` API adaptation |
| Iframe resource URL | `resourceUrl` uses a signed, opaque path capability scoped to one user, one book, one extracted archive version, read-only access, and a bounded expiry. It must not contain the login JWT. | `acceptable-change` security hardening |
| Resource route | A route outside Bearer middleware validates the capability before every XHTML/CSS/image/font request. Invalid, expired, wrong-book, wrong-version, or malformed capabilities return an error and never fall back to another path. | `must-fix` for multi-user isolation |
| Relative resources | The capability is a path segment shared by the chapter and its resource root, so ordinary relative EPUB URLs resolve under the same authorization scope. | `must-fix` |
| XHTML handling | XHTML is served dynamically with the OpenReader bridge and restrictive response headers. Original archived files remain unmodified. EPUB-authored executable scripts and remote network loads are disabled; internal document links, CSS, images, and fonts remain usable. | `acceptable-change` security hardening |
| Errors | Archive missing/corrupt, unsafe path, extraction limit, missing resource, and capability failure have distinguishable HTTP status/error responses. The frontend shows the chapter load error and retry action instead of an empty iframe. | `must-fix` |

The concrete additive response shape is:

```json
{
  "chapter": {},
  "content": "plain-text fallback used by existing search/cache flows",
  "format": "epub",
  "resourceUrl": "/api/epub-resource/<signed-capability>/<chapter-path>",
  "resourceExpiresAt": "RFC3339 timestamp"
}
```

For non-EPUB chapters, `format` is `text`, and `resourceUrl`/`resourceExpiresAt` are omitted.

### Data and parser contract

| Concern | Current OpenReader evidence | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| Persistent source | Import already archives `OriginalFile` under `library/<LibraryPath>` and stores `LibraryPath`, `TOCFile`, and chapter rows. | Preserve all existing rows/files; no destructive migration and no re-upload requirement. |
| Current flattening | `ParseEPUBWithRule` reads spine XHTML and stores only extracted text in per-chapter caches. | Keep the text copy for search/fallback, but retain each chapter's canonical EPUB resource path in the imported chapter contract so the original document can be served. Existing imports must recover this mapping from the archived EPUB when first opened. |
| Derived extraction | No extracted EPUB resource tree currently exists. | Extract to a derived versioned directory under the book's existing library directory. It is disposable/rebuildable and must be included in volume-path safety checks, not treated as a new persistent database source of truth. |
| Archive version | The source EPUB may be replaced while its library path stays stable. | Bind extracted data and resource capabilities to a deterministic source fingerprint; stale extraction/capabilities cannot read the replacement archive. |
| Archive safety | Existing parser reads selected ZIP entries but does not provide a full resource-serving extraction boundary. | Reject absolute paths, `..` traversal, drive prefixes, NUL names, symlinks, duplicate/conflicting paths, excessive entry counts, oversized entries, and excessive total uncompressed size. Never write outside the derived extraction root. |
| Media handling | Current reader has no EPUB resource MIME contract. | Serve XHTML/HTML, CSS, common images, SVG, and fonts with correct MIME types, `nosniff`, no-referrer, and a restrictive CSP. Unknown executable/media types are denied rather than served as active content. |

### EPUB implementation validation evidence

Backend/API tests:

1. `backend/api.TestDirectEPUBImportAndRefreshUseTocRule` imports a fixture EPUB containing XHTML, relative CSS, image, same-document hash, cross-chapter link, and active-script attempts; it verifies searchable text plus canonical `resourcePath`.
2. The same API test verifies existing imported EPUB rows without `resourcePath` recover metadata from `OriginalFile` without schema/data loss.
3. The chapter endpoint returns the additive EPUB response while ordinary text responses remain backward-compatible.
4. A valid capability serves chapter XHTML and relative resources with MIME/security headers and rebuilds missing derived extraction data.
5. Modified capability, stale archive version, ownership-changed book, missing resource, and unsupported active content are rejected.
6. `backend/services/epubreader` tests reject ZIP-slip, symlink, duplicate path, entry-count, per-entry-size, total-expanded-size, and symlink-ancestor extraction paths.
7. `backend/db.TestAutoMigrateAddsEPUBResourcePathWithoutLosingChapters` verifies additive migration of old chapter rows.

Frontend unit/contract tests:

1. `frontend/tests/readerChapterLoader.test.mjs` verifies `format: epub` renders through the dedicated iframe branch and never ordinary paragraph blocks.
2. `frontend/tests/readerEpubFrame.test.mjs` verifies bridge origin/source validation and `inited`, `load`, `setHeight`, `click`, `clickHash`, `keydown`, and `previewImageList` forwarding.
3. `frontend/tests/readerMode.test.mjs` verifies EPUB forces the upstream vertical-page branch even when the stored reader mode is flip/scroll.
4. `frontend/tests/readerViewportProgress.test.mjs` verifies EPUB progress is stored as document scroll pixels.

Real-browser gate:

1. `scripts/smoke/reader-epub-contract.mjs` opens the fixture at 1440×900, 390×844, and 360×800 against a real local server.
2. It confirms XHTML typography, upstream reader style override, preserved non-typography CSS, relative CSS/image/font loads, image preview, internal hash, cross-chapter link, keyboard forwarding, center-click toolbar behavior, panel coexistence, and saved-position restoration.
3. It confirms no resource `401`, no blank page, no authored script execution, no ordinary paragraph blocks, and no duplicate center-click toggle.

Deferred from this EPUB slice:

- TTS/read-aloud and auto-reading behavior: upstream hides some reader controls for EPUB while `Content.vue` contains generic autoplay methods. This requires a separate evidence pass before claiming parity.
- Search result navigation into exact text inside iframe content.
- Remaining CBZ archive/import and lazy-loading edge cases.

## Immediate P0 contract: CBZ/comic image and audio chapter reading

### Upstream evidence

| Feature | Upstream authority | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| CBZ detection | `web/src/components/Content.vue.isCbz`, `web/src/views/Reader.vue.isCbz` | A book whose `bookUrl` ends with `.cbz` enters the comic/CBZ branch. CBZ chapters hide the chapter title and render the chapter content as image content rather than normal prose. |
| CBZ import/catalog | `src/main/java/io/legado/app/model/localBook/CbzFile.kt`, `BookController.extractCbz`, `BookController.getLocalChapterList` | CBZ files are accepted as local books. The archive is extracted to a derived `index` directory; non-directory, non-XML entries are sorted lexicographically and become one chapter per image/file path. `ComicInfo.xml` can update title/author and the first image can become cover. |
| CBZ chapter content | `BookController.getBookContent` CBZ branch | A CBZ chapter resolves to the extracted file. Image extensions `jpg/jpeg/gif/png/bmp/webp/svg` return `<img src='__API_ROOT__...'>`; non-image files return the raw file URL. Missing extraction or missing chapter file returns an explicit error. |
| Comic image rendering | `Content.vue.render` and `renderScrollChapterList` | Any content containing `<img` enters a comic/image rendering path. Image `src` is rewritten to lazy `data-src`; `__API_ROOT__` is expanded; image click opens preview. `isCarToon` disables auto-reading/TTS controls. |
| Audio detection | `Content.vue.isAudio`, `Reader.vue.isAudio` | A book with `readingBook.type === 1` enters an audio branch. Audio disables scroll/slide page interactions, keyboard paging, progress slider display in mini interface, auto-reading, and speech/TTS controls. |
| Audio player | `Content.vue.renderAudio` | Audio content is rendered by an `<audio preload>` element whose `src` is the chapter content URL. The UI includes cover, elapsed/total time, seek slider, -15s/+15s, previous/next chapter, play/pause, volume mute and volume slider. |
| Audio state transitions | `Content.vue.play/computeDuration/onTimeupdate/onEnd/prevChapter/nextChapter` | Initial mount calls `play(true)` and computes duration. If `autoPlay` is true the element starts playback. `timeupdate` emits progress update; `ended` resets current time/duration, enables autoplay, and advances to the next chapter. Previous/next chapter buttons set autoplay and emit chapter navigation. |
| Reader input guard | `Reader.vue.handleTouchStart/eventHandler/keydownHandler` | Parent touch and keyboard handlers return early for audio. Center tap only toggles the toolbar when read bar is not shown; it must not page text. |

### Current OpenReader evidence and classification

| Layer | Current OpenReader evidence | Difference | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local import allow-list | `backend/api/imports.go`, `backend/api/localstore.go`, `backend/api/books.go.isSupportedLocalBookFile` accept `txt/text/md/epub/pdf/umd` but not `.cbz`. | New CBZ local imports are rejected even though upstream accepts CBZ. | `must-fix` |
| CBZ parsing/extraction | No current Go CBZ parser/extractor exists in `backend/engine` or `backend/services/localbook`; frontend only infers CBZ from existing book path fields. | Existing legacy CBZ rows may render if content already contains `<img>`, but OpenReader cannot build upstream-style CBZ chapter rows from the archive. | `must-fix` |
| CBZ content response | `backend/api/books.go.getBookChapterContent` always returns `format: "text"` except EPUB; no CBZ branch generates `<img src='...'>` from an extracted page. | A CBZ chapter cannot be served through the upstream chapter-content contract. | `must-fix` |
| Image rendering | `frontend/src/components/reader/ReaderChapterContent.vue`, `useReaderChapterPresentation.js`, `parseReaderContentBlocks` already convert `<img>` to image blocks, hide CBZ titles, collect preview image lists, and recompute layout on image load. | This is a Vue 3 equivalent for HTML image chapters, but it depends on the backend producing the right image chapter content. | `technical-stack-equivalent`, pending backend CBZ support |
| Lazy-loading model | Upstream uses `v-lazy-container` and `data-src`; OpenReader uses Element Plus `el-image lazy` with preview. | Visible behavior is acceptable if images load lazily, trigger layout recomputation, and preview does not toggle toolbar. | `acceptable-change` |
| Audio detection/API | Current Reader has TTS/Web Speech but no chapter `format: "audio"` response and no book `type === 1` reader branch. | Upstream audio books cannot be represented as audio in the rewritten Reader. | `must-fix` |
| Audio UI | No `ReaderAudioContent`/audio player component exists. | Missing cover/progress/seek/chapter/volume controls and audio-specific event handling. | `must-fix` |
| Reader controls | Current toolbar disables TTS for EPUB only; image/comic detection exists, but audio-specific touch/keyboard guards are absent because no audio state exists. | Audio must suppress paging and speech/auto-reading like upstream. | `must-fix` |

### OpenReader adaptation contract

| Concern | Required behavior | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| CBZ storage | Accept `.cbz` in upload/import/local-store paths. Preserve the original archive under the existing `library/` model and derive extracted pages under a rebuildable, user-scoped directory inside that book's library root. | `must-fix` |
| CBZ archive safety | Reject ZIP-slip paths, absolute paths, drive prefixes, NUL names, symlinks, duplicate/conflicting paths, excessive entry counts, excessive per-entry size, and excessive total expanded size. Never write outside the derived extraction root. | `acceptable-change` security hardening |
| CBZ catalog | Build chapter rows by lexicographically sorted non-directory image entries. `ComicInfo.xml` is metadata only and must not become a readable chapter. Unsupported non-image entries should not break import; if retained for upstream parity, serving them must use a safe static resource route and explicit MIME handling. | `must-fix` |
| CBZ cover/info | If present, parse `ComicInfo.xml` for title/author and use the first valid image as cover without requiring network access. | `must-fix` |
| CBZ chapter endpoint | `GET /api/books/:id/chapters/:index/content` may keep the existing JSON envelope but must mark CBZ explicitly, for example `format: "cbz"` plus `content: "<img src='...'>"` or equivalent image metadata. Existing text clients must not break. | `acceptable-change` API adaptation |
| CBZ resource serving | Page image URLs must be same-origin, user/book scoped, and safe for iframe/image loading without exposing another user's library path. Current JWT-bearing API routes may serve JSON; direct image resources need either cookie-compatible auth or signed scoped capabilities. | `acceptable-change` security hardening |
| CBZ frontend | Reader must hide CBZ chapter titles, render image pages full readable width, keep mobile padding symmetric, recompute pagination/progress after image load, and keep image preview clicks from toggling toolbar. | `must-fix` |
| Audio chapter API | Introduce an explicit audio chapter contract instead of overloading text content. The chapter response should identify audio, provide a same-origin/signed resource URL, title, cover, and enough progress metadata to save current playback seconds. | `must-fix` |
| Audio frontend | Add a dedicated audio content branch/component with upstream controls: cover, elapsed/total duration, seek, -15s/+15s, previous/next chapter, play/pause, mute and volume. Mount should load metadata and respect autoplay after manual previous/next or ended advancement. | `must-fix` |
| Audio progress | Save audio progress on `timeupdate` as chapter position/time without disturbing text scroll position semantics. On chapter reopen, restore the saved playback second before autoplay. | `must-fix` |
| Audio input model | Parent touch/click/keyboard paging handlers must return early for audio. Center tap toggles toolbar only; audio must not trigger page navigation, auto-reading, or TTS. | `must-fix` |

### Recommended tests before implementation

Backend/API:

1. Import a fixture CBZ containing `ComicInfo.xml`, nested image paths, mixed image extensions, and one unsupported file; verify title/author/cover and sorted chapter rows.
2. Chapter content for a CBZ image returns explicit CBZ/image format and a safe same-origin image URL; missing extraction rebuilds from the preserved archive.
3. CBZ security tests reject traversal, absolute paths, duplicate normalized paths, symlink-like entries, excessive entry count, per-entry size, and total expanded size.
4. Existing TXT/EPUB/PDF/UMD imports and old local-store rows remain unchanged.
5. Audio fixture/API test verifies an audio chapter response shape, saved playback progress, previous/next autoplay state, and access isolation for the audio resource.

Frontend unit/contract:

1. `ReaderChapterContent` keeps CBZ titles hidden and treats image-only blocks as comic blocks.
2. Image load emits pagination/progress recomputation and preview click does not pass through to the reader click zones.
3. `ReaderAudioContent` renders upstream-equivalent controls and normalizes duration/time/volume.
4. Reader mode/input tests verify audio disables scroll/slide paging, keyboard paging, auto-reading, and TTS controls.
5. Progress persistence tests verify audio seconds do not overwrite text paragraph offsets incorrectly.

Real-browser gate:

1. Open a CBZ fixture at 1440×900, 390×844, and 360×800; confirm sorted pages, hidden titles, full-width images, symmetric mobile padding, preview, and no stale pagination after image load.
2. Open an audio fixture at the same viewports; confirm metadata load, seek, -15s/+15s, previous/next chapter, volume/mute, ended-to-next behavior, and restored playback second.
3. Confirm toolbar/panel coexistence still follows the Reader mobile state contract and that audio/image interactions do not produce blank pages or unintended center-click toggles.

Deferred from this slice:

- Full online audio book-source parsing semantics, if upstream source rules expose audio differently from local/imported chapters.
- Browser autoplay restrictions: OpenReader may require an explicit user gesture before first audio playback, but previous/next and ended autoplay should match upstream after the user has interacted.

## Required workflow for each future module

1. Use `readerdev-compat-inventory`.
2. Update this file or a focused `docs/compat/*.md` contract.
3. Add/update tests for `must-fix` behavior.
4. Implement OpenReader changes.
5. Run module gate and record allowed differences.
6. Publish Git commits promptly. Publish Docker after any coherent, fully verified slice suitable for user validation; a complete module boundary remains preferred.
